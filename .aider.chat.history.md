The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo image that should be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
